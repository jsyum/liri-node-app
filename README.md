This is a command line application and Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI).

To use this app, first use terminal to change directory to the liri-node-app folder. To make your first request in the command line, enter the first two arguments, ‘node liri’ followed by either movie-this, concert-this, spotify-this-song, or do-what-it-says, followed by the specific query in quotes.

Here is a complete example call:
node liri concert-this “Ariana grande”

This will display results from the Bands in Town API with information about her next show.
Similarly, using the command movie-this will display information from the IMDB API, and Spotify-this-song and do-what-it-says will display select information from the Spotify API.
